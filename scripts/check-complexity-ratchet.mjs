// check-complexity-ratchet (G16) — the harness's own machinery, held to the bar it enforces.
//
// The harness reds a CONSUMER whose function exceeds cognitive-complexity 15. Its own installer
// does not comply, and that was always known: eleven functions carry an inline
// `eslint-disable-next-line sonarjs/cognitive-complexity -- ratchet(v0.1.5): N today; do not
// raise`, and the CHANGELOG promised those "may not grow".
//
// NOTHING ENFORCED THAT PROMISE. A disable directive suppresses the rule ENTIRELY on its
// function, so `init()` could go from 133 to 500 and `eslint .` stayed green. The "N today" was
// prose, and it had already drifted (doctor.mjs claimed 74; it measures 73). The one thing the
// directive does catch is a function dropping back UNDER 15 — reportUnusedDisableDirectives reds
// a directive nothing uses. A floor, never a ceiling.
//
// This is the ceiling. It re-lints with --no-inline-config, so the disables are IGNORED and the
// rule reports every over-limit function WITH ITS ACTUAL SCORE, then compares each against a
// committed record (scripts/complexity-ratchet.json).
//
//   node scripts/check-complexity-ratchet.mjs           # the gate (machinery-lint, blocking)
//   node scripts/check-complexity-ratchet.mjs --write   # re-record after a REVIEWED refactor
//
// The comparison itself lives in scripts/lib/complexity.mjs so it can be proven red without a
// 15-second ESLint run (tests/gates/check-complexity-ratchet.test.mjs).

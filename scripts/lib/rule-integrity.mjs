 * Compare the depcruise forbidden rules, the depcruise SCAN OPTIONS, and the eslint config text
 * against the committed record. Four ways to red — each closing a hole the adversarial review of
 * v0.1.6 confirmed was open:
 *
 *   - A recorded depcruise rule is GONE (deleted) — the "silently no-op'd rule" G28 names: the
 *     gate still runs and exits 0.
 *   - A depcruise rule CHANGED (hash mismatch) — a narrowed from/to regex neuters a rule while
 *     keeping its name.
 *   - The depcruise OPTIONS changed — `exclude`/`doNotFollow`/`includeOnly` shrink the SCANNED
 *     SET, so a rule can be neutered by starving it of files without touching any rule object
 *     (every ruleHash stays identical). This is why the options are hashed separately.
 *   - The eslint config text changed — the two import bans were previously checked by bare
 *     substring, which caught a deleted `group:` array but NOT a severity flipped to 'off' or a
 *     `files`/`ignores` scope broadened to match nothing (both leave the substring intact). The
 *     whole config text is hashed instead, so any weakening reds; the reviewer reads the diff.
 *
 * A NEW depcruise rule the record does not know also reds (register it) — the record cannot
 * silently fall behind the config it vouches for.

-- The owner check is wrapped in a scalar sub-select so it evaluates once per
-- statement (initPlan) instead of per row. nullif(current_setting(..., true), '')
-- maps BOTH no-identity shapes to NULL — an unset GUC returns NULL, but a pooled
-- session that ever ran SET LOCAL returns '' afterwards, which would make a bare
-- ::uuid cast raise 22P02 instead of cleanly denying. NULL never equals an
-- owner_id, so "no identity" fails closed. Four per-operation policies, never
-- FOR ALL, so read and write intents can diverge later without a rewrite.

// Keyset-cursor codec for the notes list. The cursor is the (created_at, id)
// key of the last row on the page, base64url-encoded JSON — opaque to clients
// (they echo it back verbatim), fully validated on the way in.
// SOURCE: opaque page tokens per Google AIP-158 https://google.aip.dev/158

// createdAt is carried VERBATIM as the driver returned it (Postgres text form,
// microsecond precision). Re-encoding through a JS Date would truncate to
// milliseconds and make the keyset comparison skip rows that share a
// millisecond — precision is the correctness of the cursor.
//
// Anchored at BOTH ends, unlike the DTO's shape check in @app/schema: this validates
// WIRE input (a cursor a client hands back), not driver output. An unanchored tail let
// `2024-01-01 12:00:00 (x)` through — V8's date parser skips parenthesized comments —
// and the driver then raised a cast error on the `::timestamptz` bind.

/**
 * Shape AND calendar. The shape check alone is not enough, in two directions:
 *
 * - The old refine was `!Number.isNaN(Date.parse(value))`, and Date.parse is NOT a calendar
 *   oracle — it silently ROLLS OVER an impossible day (`2024-02-30` -> Mar 1, `2023-02-29`
 *   -> Mar 1). Those decoded fine and were then bound as `::timestamptz`, where Postgres
 *   raised a cast error: a 500, where the contract below promises a 400.
 * - The old regex was unanchored at the END, so `2024-01-01 12:00:00 (x)` matched on its
 *   prefix (V8's date parser even skips parenthesized comments) and reached the driver too.
 *
 * So: anchor both ends, then require the instant to survive a canonical round-trip. `toJSON`
 * (not `toISOString`) returns null rather than THROWING on an out-of-range field like month
 * 13 or hour 25. One comparison, not six per-component ones — every rollover perturbs at
 * least two components at once, which makes per-component checks mutually redundant and
 * individually unpinnable by any test.
 * SOURCE: ECMA-262 MakeDay performs no calendar validation — out-of-range days roll over

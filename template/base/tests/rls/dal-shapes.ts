// The DAL query-shape registry the plan probe drives (v0.1.6). SEEDED — this file is
// yours: `update` never rewrites it, and it grows with your DAL.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 0.1.6 the plan probe EXPLAINed exactly one statement, and that
// statement was hand-written in the probe itself:
//     SELECT * FROM notes
// It asserted the table was not reached by a Seq Scan, and it was right — and useless,
// because the application never issues that query. What notesDal.list() actually emits is
// a keyset seek with an ORDER BY, and for five releases it planned a top-N sort over the
// owner's ENTIRE partition (100 010 rows read to return a 51-row page) with the row-value
// cursor demoted from an Index Cond to a Filter. Every gate was green. The probe had
// simply never looked at the query.
//
// So the probe no longer writes its own SQL. Every shape below CALLS THE REAL DAL through
// a capturing drizzle pg-proxy — the same seam apps/server/src/dal/notes.statements.test.ts
// uses to count statements — and the SQL that gets EXPLAINed is the SQL the DAL emitted,
// byte for byte, parameters and all. A registry of copied query TEXT would drift from the
// DAL the first time someone edited a .where(); this cannot drift, because there is
// nothing to copy.
//
// REGISTER EVERY DAL METHOD, AND EVERY INTERESTING ARGUMENT SHAPE. plan-regression.test.ts
// imports each apps/server/src/dal/*.ts, enumerates the methods on its `*Dal` export, and
// FAILS if any method has no entry here — a query nothing measures cannot be added by
// accident. Argument shapes matter as much as methods: a first page and a cursor page plan
// differently (the cursor adds the row-value range condition), so both are registered.
// Extra entries are always safe; each costs one EXPLAIN against the seeded table.
//
// The probe runs `EXPLAIN` — it PLANS, it never EXECUTES — so registering create/remove
// shapes writes and deletes nothing.

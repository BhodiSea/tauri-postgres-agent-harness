// EXPLAIN plan-regression probe: at realistic scale, every RLS-scoped query the DAL
// ACTUALLY ISSUES must reach its table through an index that serves the whole query —
// the policy predicate, the ordering, and the keyset range — with identity resolved ONCE
// per statement (initPlan), never per row. The isolation suite proves WHO can see rows;
// this file proves the ACCESS PATH — the classic silent failure is a green isolation
// matrix over 4 rows that ships a sequential scan at 2 million.
//
// TWO probes, and the second exists because the first was not enough.
//
//   (1) POLICY SHAPE (the 0.1.4 probe, unchanged): EXPLAIN a bare `SELECT * FROM <table>`
//       and assert the policy alone reaches the table by index, once per statement. That
//       is a statement about the POLICY, independent of any DAL — still worth making, but
//       it is not a statement about the application.
//
//   (2) DAL SHAPES (v0.1.6): EXPLAIN every query the DAL really emits. Probe (1) passed
//       for five releases while notesDal.list() — the only list query the app has — planned
//       a top-N sort over the owner's ENTIRE partition (100 010 rows read to return a
//       51-row page, 1 032 buffers) with the row-value cursor demoted from an Index Cond to
//       a Filter. Nothing was wrong with probe (1); it was looking at a statement nobody
//       runs. So probe (2) does not write SQL at all: it calls the real DAL through a
//       capturing drizzle pg-proxy and EXPLAINs the bytes the DAL emitted. tests/rls/
//       dal-shapes.ts is the registry, and EVERY DAL method must appear in it — the closure
//       check below fails when one does not, so an unmeasured query cannot be added by
//       accident.
//
// Method: bulk-seed PROBE_ROWS rows across PROBE_OWNERS distinct synthetic owners as the
// migrator (RLS WITH CHECK forbids cross-owner seeding via the app role, and ANALYZE
// requires table ownership) with FORCE lifted transactionally — FORCE binds the OWNER too,
// so even the migrator cannot touch foreign rows without it — pin statistics with ANALYZE,
// then run a plain EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) AS app_api and assert the plan shape. EXPLAIN
// PLANS, it never EXECUTES, so the registered create/remove shapes write and delete
// nothing. Assertions run only through the unprivileged role; the migrator connection
// seeds and cleans, nothing else.

// Planner math the constants must respect. TWO independent requirements, and until 0.1.6
// only the first was understood:
//
//   SELECTIVITY — the policy qual `owner = (select …)` is an unknown Param at plan time, so
//     it is estimated at 1/n_distinct, NOT from the actual owner. With only 2 owners that is
//     50% and a Seq Scan is the CORRECT plan, so the probe must seed many distinct owners or
//     its "no Seq Scan" assertion is meaningless. 100 owners → 1% estimated → the index wins
//     decisively, and removing it flips the plan to Seq Scan, which is exactly the regression.
//
//   ROWS PER OWNER > PAGE SIZE — this is the one the old probe got wrong, and it is why the
//     missing keyset index survived five releases. At 10 rows per owner (its old 10k/1k seed)
//     a 51-row page is the owner's ENTIRE data: there is nothing to sort, the ORDER BY is
//     free, and an index that carries the ordering saves nothing. The planner correctly
//     chooses a sort, and a probe asserting "no Sort" there would be asserting something
//     FALSE. A keyset index only earns its keep once a user has more rows than a page — so
//     the seed must give them more. 250 rows per owner (a modest real user; the page is 51)
//     puts the plan firmly on the far side of the crossover: with the composite index the
//     planner walks it in order and stops at 51; without it, it reads all 250 and sorts —
//     which is what the gate must be able to see.
//
// Measured crossover on PG16 with this schema: 10 rows/owner → Sort (correct); 100+ →
// ordered Index Scan. 250 leaves comfortable headroom on both sides.

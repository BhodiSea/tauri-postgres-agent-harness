-- db/init/01-roles.sql — dev-only role bootstrap. Runs ONCE, as the postgres
-- superuser, on the first `docker compose up` (docker-entrypoint-initdb.d).
-- Roles are infrastructure, not schema: they are created here, never in drizzle
-- migrations (BUILD-SPEC §Database roles). Passwords follow the documented
-- 'postgres' local-dev convention — never reuse these outside docker-compose.

-- app_migrator owns the schema and runs migrations. CREATEDB lets the RLS
-- runner build scratch databases without borrowing superuser.

// The PR mutation lane's diff scoper: prints the CRITICAL source files this change touches,
// comma-separated, for `stryker run --mutate <list>`. Prints nothing when the change touches
// none — the lane then skips, and a PR that only edits docs or a React component pays zero
// mutation time.
//
// StrykerJS has NO git-diff scoping of its own. `--in-diff` is a cargo-mutants flag, and
// Stryker's `--incremental` is a RESULT CACHE (it reuses a stored report), not a diff scope —
// depending on it in CI would mean depending on a cache that misses. So the scope is computed
// here, explicitly, and handed to `--mutate`. That is also what keeps the ratchet honest: the
// report's file set is exactly the set we chose, so the ratchet's file-scoped comparison
// (tools/check-mutation-ratchet.mjs) knows precisely which baseline entries are in play.
//
// FILE granularity, not line ranges. Stryker can mutate `file.ts:10-25`, which would be even
// cheaper — but then a partially-mutated file's OTHER baseline survivors would be absent from
// the report and the ratchet would read them as "killed" and offer to erase them. Whole-file
// scoping keeps the report a complete statement about every file in it.

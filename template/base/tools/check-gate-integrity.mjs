// editor) into a gate script, hook, or the settings surface reds the very next
// validate run. Scope: manifest entries that are harness-OWNED and inside the
// gate surface (tools/, .claude/hooks/, .claude/settings.json, .github/workflows/,
// the RLS and migration runners). 'config' entries are skipped — they are

//   3. escape lists undirty   — widening a security/budget escape is a reviewed commit
// Static and fast: sha256 recompute + two cheap git reads.

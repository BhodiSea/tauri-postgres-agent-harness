# Approved tools registry (MCP servers & Agent Skills)

SOURCE: docs/harness/README.md (allowlist-only, scan-before-install,
re-review-on-version-bump). MCP servers and Skills run with your privileges and can be
steered by prompt injection — a regulated operator must vet them, not trust them.

## Policy (default-deny)

1. **Default deny.** No MCP server or Skill runs on this codebase unless it is listed
   below, version-pinned to a reviewed commit. Prefer official/first-party servers.
2. **Vet before approve.** Read the `SKILL.md` and every bundled script; flag
   `allowed-tools: Bash(*)`, network calls, env-var harvesting, instructions hidden in
   comments; run a scanner; record provenance + a written trust rationale. Skills that
   ship executable scripts are ~2× higher risk — scan accordingly.
3. **Re-review on every version bump** (rug-pull defense — approving v1 does not
   approve v2).
4. **Least privilege + sandbox.** Scope tools per subagent; never hand an MCP server
   the migrator DSN, signing material, or user PII. Keep private data out of the lethal
   trifecta (see `sandbox-and-supply-chain.md`).

## Approved registry

| Tool | Type | Source / pin | Reviewed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `corpus_search` | MCP (local stdio) | `tools/mcp/corpus-search-server.mjs` @ this repo | self-authored | citation grounding; no network, reads only the local pinned corpus (`tools/mcp/corpus/index.json`) |
| `rls_verify` | MCP (local stdio) | `tools/mcp/rls-verify-server.mjs` @ this repo | self-authored | mid-turn cross-user RLS probe; connects only to the local `DATABASE_URL` as the unprivileged `app_api` role; read-only, always rolled back |

Anything not listed here does not run. Record scan results + pinned versions as evidence
for security reviews. Both shipped servers are wired in `.mcp.json` and allow-listed in
`.claude/settings.json` (`enabledMcpjsonServers`); adding a third requires a registry
row FIRST, then a human edit to those files (both write-guard/permission-protected).

## Privileged database access (the migrator carve-out)

There is no service key in this stack; the equivalent privilege is
`MIGRATOR_DATABASE_URL` — the `app_migrator` role owns the schema, so it can rewrite
the RLS policies themselves (and would bypass them entirely on any table missing
FORCE). The API never uses this role. Sanctioned uses, enforced by the bash guard:

1. `drizzle-kit migrate` / `generate` / `check` (`pnpm db:migrate`),
2. `tests/migrations/migration-apply.mjs` (the fresh-apply runner behind the RLS suite).

Anything else that wants the migrator DSN needs a governing ADR (`docs/adr/`), a row in
this registry, and CODEOWNERS sign-off — there is no other sanctioned home for
privileged database access.

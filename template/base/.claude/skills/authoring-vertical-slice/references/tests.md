# Tests reference

Two vitest projects are defined in the root `vitest.config.ts` — `unit-node`
(packages/**, apps/server; node) and `unit-dom` (apps/desktop; jsdom). Tests are
colocated `*.test.ts(x)` or under `tests/unit/`. NEVER create a `vitest.workspace`
file or call `defineWorkspace` — the write-guard denies it (single gate surface).

## RLS isolation (the keystone)

For every new user-scoped table, add one entry to `ISOLATION_TARGETS` in
`tests/rls/db-context.ts`:

```ts
{
  table: '<table>',
  ownerColumn: 'owner_id',
  seedRow: (ownerId) => ({ owner_id: ownerId, /* NOT NULL columns */ }),
}
```

The existing suite (`tests/rls/cross-tenant-isolation.test.ts`) then asserts the full
matrix per target: seeded POSITIVE CONTROL (user A sees its own row — a deny-all
database must not pass), cross-user SELECT → 0 rows, UPDATE/DELETE → count 0, INSERT
smuggling the other user's id → SQLSTATE 42501 (`WITH CHECK`), the pooled-connection
GUC-leak probe (pool max=1 on purpose), and the pg_catalog gate (ENABLE + FORCE +
per-op policies, leading-column owner index, initPlan-shaped predicates, no
BYPASSRLS). The plan probe (`tests/rls/plan-regression.test.ts`) additionally
bulk-seeds 10k rows and asserts via EXPLAIN that every target is reached through
its owner index with a once-per-statement InitPlan — an entry without its index
migration fails here AND in the static `schema-rls` gate. Run: `pnpm test:rls`
(needs `pnpm db:up`; it fresh-applies all migrations from zero into a SCRATCH
database `<db>_rls` under an advisory lock — dev data is never dropped). Skips are
loud locally and FAIL CLOSED in CI. Test bodies are editable;
`tests/rls/run-rls.mjs` and `tests/migrations/migration-apply.mjs` are
write-guard-protected.

## Server units (unit-node)

- Inject a fake DAL through `createApp({ notesDal })`-style options — routes depend
  on the interface in `src/types.ts`, so no database is needed.
- Cover: DTO mapping including the `undefined` branches `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
  forces; bad/missing token → bare 401 envelope; error-envelope shape on
  validation/unknown-route/oversized-body paths (see `app.errors.test.ts`);
  middleware coverage (walk `app.routes` and assert every `/api/*` route sits
  behind skew + auth — see `middleware/skew.test.ts`); SSE abort propagation
  in-process (client abort → producer stops — see `app.sse.test.ts`); auth
  clock-skew boundaries (±4 min passes, ±6 min fails, `clockTolerance: 300`).
- Every new DAL list function gets a statement-count invariance test
  (`dal/notes.statements.test.ts` pattern): the call executes a FIXED number of
  statements regardless of row count.

## Coverage floor

`vitest run --coverage` (the Stop hook's unit step) enforces the thresholds in
`vitest.config.ts` — write the tests WITH the feature, not after; a slice that
drops global coverage below the floor cannot end its turn.

## Parsers (fast-check)

Deterministic parsers get property tests plus one pinned fixture — see
`packages/importer/src/parse.test.ts`: round-trip (`format(parse(x)) === x`-shaped)
and quote/escape invariants over generated inputs, always with a FIXED
`{ seed, numRuns }` (the `FC_PARAMS` pattern — a randomly-seeded property test is
a flake generator). No live model calls anywhere; LLM-shaped code tests against
`FakeInferenceProvider` from `@app/eval`, and extraction outputs are accepted
ONLY through `parseExtraction` (schema-valid AND evidence-grounded — offsets
must slice to the quoted text).

## Desktop (unit-dom)

Testing Library for feature components (accessible-name queries, keyboard events).
New shortcuts only need their `src/keyboard/registry.ts` entry — `registry.test.ts`
structurally enforces WCAG 2.1.4 over the whole registry — but new key-handling
LOGIC gets its own test.

## Rules that keep the gate honest

- Never edit a test and its implementation in the same turn to turn red green; if a
  test is wrong, report it and stop.
- Never weaken assertions, remove positive controls, or `.skip` a failing test.
- Mutation-survivable assertions: specific values and fail-closed behaviour (0 rows,
  exact SQLSTATE, exact DTO shape), not "it ran".
- Annotate non-obvious fixtures (token minting, seeded users) with `// SOURCE:`.

Commands: `pnpm test` · `pnpm test:rls` · `pnpm validate` (the Stop hook runs all
three directly — done means green).

// StrykerJS — the behavioural net over the critical surface (auth, the DAL, the error
// envelope, the route wiring, and the desktop's auth/transport seam). Coverage says your
// tests RAN the code; mutation says they would NOTICE it breaking.
//
// CI-ONLY. Never `pnpm validate`, never the Stop hook: a full run is minutes and the warm
// validate budget is ~6s. Two lanes, both blocking, both ending in the SET-BASED ratchet
// (tools/check-mutation-ratchet.mjs) rather than a score threshold:
//   - per-PR   : `pnpm mutation:ci`  — mutates only the CRITICAL files the PR touched
//   - nightly  : `pnpm mutation`     — the whole critical surface
//
// WHAT IS MUTATED lives in tools/lib/mutation-critical.mjs, shared with the diff-scoper so
// the two can never disagree about what "critical" means.

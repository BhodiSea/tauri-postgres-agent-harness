// tools/harness.config.mjs — the single source of truth for the quality gate.
// Consumed by tools/validate.mjs (`pnpm validate`), the Stop hook, and CI, so the three
// enforcement layers can never disagree about what "done" means.
//
// HARNESS-PROTECTED: the write-guard hook denies agent edits to this file unless
// HARNESS_ALLOW_SELF_EDIT=1 is set, and CI re-runs the same steps with a hardcoded
// floor (`node tools/validate.mjs --min-floor`) — so editing this config can ADD
// steps but can never weaken the non-negotiable ones.
// SOURCE: docs/harness/README.md (the gate config is harness-protected and mirrored in CI) [corpus: harness/doctrine]

// Each step is [name, shellCommand]. Steps run sequentially, cheap → expensive;
// the first failure stops the run. Toolchain-dependent steps (rust-fmt, rust-check)
// and surface-dependent gate scripts self-skip LOUDLY when their prerequisite is
// absent locally and fail closed in CI (HARNESS_REQUIRE_TOOLCHAINS=1) — a skip
// must never be mistakable for a pass.

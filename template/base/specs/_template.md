# Spec: <feature>

<!--
Spec-first SOP (SOURCE: docs/harness/README.md — spec-first SOP): for any change
touching auth, RLS, migrations, the Tauri security surface (capabilities/CSP), or the
API contract — write this spec, get human sign-off, THEN implement (ideally in a fresh
session). The spec is necessary but not sufficient; the gate holds the line either way.
Copy to specs/<feature>.md and fill in.

**Summary / one-liner:**

**Why now / success looks like (measurable):**

**Goals / Non-goals:**

**Files & interfaces touched (name them):**

**Security invariants implicated** (RLS policies? DAL/`withUserContext`? migration —
expand/contract phase? auth verification? Tauri capability or CSP `connect-src`
change? new `#[tauri::command]`? keyboard shortcut? prompt/lock change?):

**Contract impact** (`openapi.json` diff? N-1 desktop clients still work — see
`docs/runbooks/expand-contract.md`?):

**Out of scope:**

**End-to-end verification step (the exact command that proves it works):**
